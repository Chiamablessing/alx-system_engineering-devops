# Regular expression
In this project, I learnt about **regular expression** a special text string for describing a search pattern. and how to use regular expressions. I practiced building them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

All code in this directory was tested using [Rubular](https://https://rubular.com/). Rubular is a Ruby-based regular expression editor. It's a handy way to test regular expressions as you write them.
